= Introduction

This document records the work I did individually on the BERFA filler detection system that Andrew
and I prepared for our individual report. While much of the work we did was quite collaborative,
we did some implementation work separately. We assigned tasks according to our strengths. For
example, as an experienced Python programmer, I handled most of the code to interface with hardware
that Andrew would have been less familiar with. And since he does have some experience training
neural networks with Python frameworks (gained primarily through this course), he handled tuning
the training code after I set up the initial loop.

This document will be divided into several sections. The next section provides a brief description
of my individual work
