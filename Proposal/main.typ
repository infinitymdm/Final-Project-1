= Proposed Concept: Automated "Ah" Counter

We propose a deep neural network designed to replicate the role of an "ah" counter, as in public
speaking organizations such as Toastmasters. The network should take real-time audio as input and
indicate whether the most recent second of audio contains filler words such as "ah" or "um".
